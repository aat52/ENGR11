                        I am a 17 year old freshman studying at the Swanson School of 
			Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. I was born in 
			Folson, California, and moved to Northern Virginia soon after. 
			From a young age, I dreamed about becoming a doctor, but was 
			not sure about what kind specifically. Surgery seemed too 
			stressful, and I had no interest in working as a general 
			practitioner. I eventually settled into becoming a psychiatrist 
			due to my own experience with mental illnesses and my desire to 
			help others. However, I still had undergraduate to consider. I 
			needed a way to achieve my goal without worrying about the 
			worst-case scenario, while still being challenged by course 
			material.

                        When I first arrived at the University of Pittsburgh, I was 
			unsure about my plans to major in bioengineering. I have always 
			favored science and the humanities, and I had plans to follow the 
			pre-medical track in hopes of becoming a doctor one day. However, 
			the idea of pursuing a degree in biology or something similar was 
			grossly unappealing to me. My research had informed me that science 
			or humanities majors often had salaries below my standards, and often 
			lacked job availability or the stability I desired after graduation. 
			I wanted a safety net, a guarantee that I would not have to worry 
			about securing a paying job after graduation, in case my plans to 
			enter medical school changed. During my search for a more suitable 
			major, I stumbled across the field known as bioengineering. It 
			immediately caught my interest. Biology, combined with the job 
			security of engineering; this major seemed to satisfy my requirements.
			In addition, the University of Pittsburgh is very supportive of 
			bioengineers in pursuit of a medical degree.

                        Looking back, I have always been interested in the manipulation 
			of neural networks and have always had a very logical approach to 
			approaching problems. It makes sense that I would be drawn to 
			bioengineering, especially to the bioimaging track. While I want 
			to spend my life helping others and learning about the mind,I also 
			want to know how it works and what can change it. Bioengineering 
			permits me to learn about the inner workings of the human body, 
			while the bioimaging track allows me to zero in on the neuroscience 
			side of bioengineering. In a larger sense, I want to spend my life 
			always learning and always helping others. Becoming a bioengineer 
			will satisfy my desire to learn about how everything works, while 
			also providing me with the information I need for my future aspirations.

                        My interests vary greatly. For example, I enjoy playing games, 
			photography, and writing in my spare time. In regards to games,
			I see them as a bonding experience with the people I play with. 
			Be it a simple card game or an online video game, I find games
			as a fun way to pass time and interact with different people. I 			
			have discovered that you can learn a lot about a person through 			
			how they respond to being bested at something, or how they respond 
			to winning. As for photography, I enjoy preserving a moment in 	
			time, for further reflection and enjoyment in the future. A 
			picture can hold emotions and memories, things that are often 
			forgotten over time. I apply a similar concept with writing. While 
			photos can often trigger a memory and are helpful in capturing a 
			moment, some ideas can only be expressed and preserved through 	
			writing. When time permits, I take the time to write and organize 
			my thoughts.
