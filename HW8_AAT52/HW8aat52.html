    		<p> The AIChE is the leading global association for chemical engineers. I think one of the most advantageous aspects of this association is being able to connect with other engineers and have access to the novel research being conducted around the world. There are many events hosted by the AIChE that allos chemical engineers to stay up to date with new discoveries.

                        My interests vary greatly. For example, I enjoy playing games, 
			photography, and writing in my spare time. In regards to games,
			I see them as a bonding experience with the people I play with. 
			Be it a simple card game or an online video game, I find games
			as a fun way to pass time and interact with different people. I 			
			have discovered that you can learn a lot about a person through 			
			how they respond to being bested at something, or how they respond 
			to winning. As for photography, I enjoy preserving a moment in 	
			time, for further reflection and enjoyment in the future. A 
			picture can hold emotions and memories, things that are often 
			forgotten over time. I apply a similar concept with writing. While 
			photos can often trigger a memory and are helpful in capturing a 
			moment, some ideas can only be expressed and preserved through 	
			writing. When time permits, I take the time to write and organize 
			my thoughts.
