		Becoming a Professional Engineer is to reach the highest level of competence in engineering. To be recognized as 
		one, you must graduate from an ABET-accredited engineering program, pass the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam,
		and work as an engineer for four years. After this, you must pass the Professional Engineering (PE) exam.Through 
		this hard work, you gain higher chances of employment, respect from peers and employers, and a sense of accomplishment.
		Professional Engineers are respected by the public because they have proven to excel in the ethical professional 
		practices that engineers must follow.
